title: "Why am I starting this blog?"

I journal regularly, I’ve been journaling since as long as I remember. I feel intense emotions, I always have. I have opinions, ideas, and doubts. I don’t want these thoughts to remain in my journal forever. I want to share these thoughts. So, this blog is going to be my little corner on the internet.

When I journal, I don’t reason so much, I just put down whatever I’m feeling or think is happening to me and around me. I feel when I’ll share these thoughts with other people, albeit anonymously, I’d be compelled to reason, and question them. And in this self reflection, I think I’ll find the answers I need.

It’s not just for me. Reading other people’s ideas and thought process can give us a fresh new perspective on things. We might or might not agree with them on everything, it still gives us new insights on new topics, and compels us to question what are our thoughts on it. And in this process, we grow. I’m this other person for anyone reading my blog and I hope my self-reflection inspires you to self-reflect as well.

I don’t know what this blog is going to become. I plan to make sure these are my words and not AI’s (Artificial Intelligence). For now, I’m going to trust the process and keep blogging everyday and hope that it leads to something amazing, for me and for anyone who stumbles upon this blog.
